/**
 * @namespace dooselection::reducer
 * @brief Reducer namespace
 *
 * This namespace contains all Reducer functionality. Reducer is a framework
 * to process and modify tuples. This includes applying selections, adding new
 * leaves and perform higher level modifications. The basic 
 * dooselection::reducer::Reducer provides standard functionality such as 
 * applying cut strings adding new leaves based on existing leaves and apply a
 * best candidate selection.
 *
 * Higher functionality is provided by derived Reducer classes which can be 
 * combined due to virtual inheritance. To develop own derived Reducers virtual
 * functions exist as hooks to interface the Reducer mechanisms.
 *
 * In principle the Reducer always works like this: An input tuple is opened and
 * an optional cut string is applied after which the input tree is copied into 
 * an interim tree. In the following step an event loop processes the interim 
 * tree, applies further cuts, calculates new leaves. Events passing the 
 * requirements are processed by an optional best candidate selection and if 
 * selected written into the output tree. 
 *
 * @section reducer_usage Usage
 *
 * Consider this example for basic usage info:
 *
 * @code
 * Reducer my_reducer;
 *
 * // set input/output files to process
 * my_reducer.set_input_file_path(input_file);
 * my_reducer.set_input_tree_path(input_tree);
 * my_reducer.set_output_file_path(output_file);
 * my_reducer.set_output_tree_path(output_tree);
 *
 * // set a cut string for the first step from input to interim tree
 * my_reducer.set_cut_string("piminus_TRACK_Type==3 && piplus_TRACK_Type==3");
 *
 * // step 1: Initialize. Open the input tree, set branch status, create interim 
 * //         tree by copying input tree with cut, open output tree and 
 * //         initialize higher level leaves.
 * my_reducer.Initialize();
 * 
 * // create custom branches via built-in functions here
 * my_reducer.CreateDoubleCopyLeaf(...);
 *
 * // step 2: Run. Prepare more higher level leaves, running event loop with 
 * //         best candidate selection and writing events into output tree.
 * my_reducer.Run();
 *
 * // step 3: Finalize. Reserved for future usage.
 * my_reducer.Finalize();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section reducer_hooks Hooks for higher level Reducers
 *
 * Reducer supports a set of virtual functions for derived higher level Reducers
 * to implement further functionality. The workflow is as this:
 *
 * @code
 * Initialize();
 * \- open input tree
 *  - dooselection::reducer::Reducer::ProcessInputTree();
 *    \- virtual function to work on the input tree before any branches are 
 *     - deactivated or cuts applied.
 *  - copy input tree into interim tree with cut
 *  - create (empty) output tree
 *  - dooselection::reducer::Reducer::CreateSpecialBranches();
 *    \- virtual function to create/prepare leaves that are to be written in
 *     - the event loop. These can be leaves based on integrated support or 
 *     - higher level leaves that need to be evaluated for each event by special
 *     - functions.
 *
 * Run();
 * \- dooselection::reducer::Reducer::PrepareSpecialBranches();
 *    \- virtual function to create/prepare leaves that are to be written in
 *     - the event loop. Similar to CreateSpecialBranches() but this function 
 *     - is assured to run after the user has created their own leaves and 
 *     - directly before the event loop.
 *  - run event loop:
 *  \- select one event
 *   - update all leaf values, including new leaves to be created
 *   - dooselection::reducer::Reducer::UpdateSpecialLeaves();
 *   \- virtual function to calculate values of higher level leaves like 
 *    - complicated vetos and such.
 *   - dooselection::reducer::Reducer::LoadTreeFriendsEntryHook(long long);
 *   \- virtual function to load tree friend entries.
 *   - dooselection::reducer::Reducer::EntryPassesSpecialCuts();
 *   \- virtual function to check if leaves fulfil higher level cuts like 
 *    - complicated vetos or any other requirement.
 *   - if passing, get best candidate of passing events.
 *   - dooselection::reducer::Reducer::FillOutputTree();
 *   \- virtual function to write a passing and best candidate selected event 
 *    - into the output tree.
 *    - Must call dooselection::reducer::Reducer::FlushEvent() at least once to
 *    - actually write the event at least once. Last chance to modify any leaf
 *    - values.
 *   - close output tree and delete interim file
 * @endcode
